# Find the largest prime factor of a number


"""
This was apart of cs135's problems, didn't know how to do it then, still don't remember the most optimal
I remember goldbach's conjecture though, since lots of my tests were very slow, we didn't have to check all the way up until
the number n, but we could guarantee sqrt(n) was sufficient.
